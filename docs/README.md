# Documentation Overview

The documentation is now grouped into focused subdirectories so contributors can quickly find the right level of detail.

- `guides/` – Task-oriented walkthroughs such as the drop-in agent workflow, SDK onboarding, operator runbook, and troubleshooting playbooks.
- `plans/` – Roadmaps, design reviews, acceptance tests, and launch readiness material that describe how the gateway evolves.
- `systems/` – Deep dives into core subsystems (security, tooling, observability, resiliency) with operational and architectural context.
- `references/` – Index and release collateral that tie the other documents together.

Start with `references/README.md` for a curated index, then drill into the relevant folder for your workstream.
